# Acne-detection
Acne, a prevalent dermatological condition affecting millions worldwide, often requires accurate and timely classification to guide effective treatment.
This project aims to harness the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automate the detection and classification of acne severity from images into three levels: 
Level 0 (mild acne), Level 1 (moderate acne), Level 2 (severe acne). 
We start with comprehensive data collection and preprocessing, followed by meticulous model development and validation to ensure accuracy. 
The trained model is then integrated into a user-friendly mobile application, designed for easy use and real-time assessment.
